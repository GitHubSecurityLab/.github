GitHub Security Lab’s mission is to empower developers and secure open source. We do that in a number of ways:
- by finding and disclosing vulnerabilities in open source. We publish our [advisories](https://securitylab.github.com/research/) on our [website](https://securitylab.github.com/).
- reviewing advisories that affect open source projects hosted on GitHub and notifying affected developers and maintainers. See [GitHub’s advisory database](https://github.com/advisories).
- educating the community and empowering developers via in-person events (you can meet us during any events listed in the [event calendar](https://securitylab.github.com/events/))
- scaling the security research community’s work with our CodeQL bug bounty programme. See [rules](https://securitylab.github.com/bounties/).

In this organisation, you will find some of our projects aiming to educate the community and empower developers or security researchers. Check out also our team repository at [github/securitylab](https://github.com/github/securitylab)
